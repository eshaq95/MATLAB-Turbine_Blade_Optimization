# Matlab Project


This is a MATLAB code that I developed for my Sustainable Energy Group Design Project report in Mechanical Engineering Design 3 for the optimization of an aerodynamic blade. The code generated the bladesâ€™ twist and chord distribution, and then selected the optimum aerofoil profile for the different sections along the blade. This allowed an efficient analysis and accurate analysis of blade dimensension that was required to generate a required power. The blade was 3D printed and tested in a lab, the outcome was very positive.

Below is a screenshot of an example result (subject to adjustable input variables):
