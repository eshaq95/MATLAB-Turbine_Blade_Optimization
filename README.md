# Matlab Projects

This repository includes my Matlab codes that I created for my Mechanical Engineering course at the University of Edinburgh.


### 1. Turbine blade dimension optizimation


This is a MATLAB code that I developed for my Sustainable Energy Group Design Project in Mechanical Engineering Design 3 for the optimization of an aerodynamic blade. The code generated the bladesâ€™ twist and chord distribution, and then selected the optimum aerofoil profile for the different sections along the blade. This allowed an efficient and accurate analysis of blade dimensension that was required to generate a required power. The blade was 3D printed and tested in a lab, the outcome was very positive. Script name in repository: TurbineOptimisation.m
