# MATLAB Projects

This repository contains MATLAB codes developed for various Mechanical Engineering courses at the University of Edinburgh. These projects showcase practical applications of MATLAB in engineering problem-solving and analysis.

## 1. Turbine Blade Dimension Optimization

**File:** `TurbineOptimisation.m`

This MATLAB code was developed for the Sustainable Energy Group Design Project in Mechanical Engineering Design 3. It focuses on the optimization of aerodynamic blade dimensions for turbines.

### Key Features:
- Generates blade twist and chord distribution
- Selects optimum aerofoil profiles for different blade sections
- Performs efficient and accurate analysis of blade dimensions for required power generation
- Results were validated through 3D printing and lab testing with positive outcomes

## 2. Numerical Solutions for Partial Differential Equations

This project focuses on implementing numerical solutions for heat and wave equations using MATLAB.

### Key Components:
- `analytical_solution.m`: Analytical solution to the PDE
- `ETM.m`: Explicit Time-Marching method implementation
- `FTCS.m`: Forward-Time Centered-Space method for finite difference solutions
- `partc.m`: Additional analysis or solution component
- `REPORT.docx`: Detailed project report including analytical calculations

## Usage

Each project folder contains the necessary MATLAB scripts and additional documentation. To run the scripts:

1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the desired project folder.
3. Open and run the main script file (e.g., `TurbineOptimisation.m` for the turbine project).
4. Refer to individual script comments or accompanying documentation for specific usage instructions.
